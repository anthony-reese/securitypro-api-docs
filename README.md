## About the API

The SecurityPro API supports:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication and token management
- User creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
- Role assignment and access control
- JSON and XML response formats
- Secure integration via HTTPS and Bearer tokens

---

## Tools Used

- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) – for rendering interactive API documentation
- [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) – for defining the API contract
- GitHub Pages – for hosting the documentation

---

## Testing the API

All endpoints in the Swagger UI are fully interactive. To test them:
1. Obtain a valid OAuth 2.0 token (real or mocked)
2. Use the `Authorize` button in the Swagger UI
3. Try any `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE` method right in your browser
